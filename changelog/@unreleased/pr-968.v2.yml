    Support lenient versions in GCV to enable Jakarta bridge migrations


    In order to support libraries like tracing-java which need
    both javax libraries and jakarta libraries, we need to have some
    way of hosting both in the same repository, but not having GCV
    force our versions of all subprojects up to that version as well.

    This introduces a mode in GCV (which is very much frowned upon
    anyone using), which instead of forcing strict versions from the
    versions.lock file, instead makes them prefer, this then lets
    subprojects force the version to strict, which overrides any
    past or future version constraints.

    I'm not super happy with this solution since it does violate some
    of the principles of GCV, but the problem we're trying to solve with
    the Jakarta migration is very much non-compliant.
