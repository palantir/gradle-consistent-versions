  description: Expose all lock file constraints as derived from `versions.lock` in
    all publications derived from `components.java`. This will most likely produce
    surprising behaviour when publishing module metadata! However, we are not using
    it internally for now, and we are planning a better solution that addresses the
    problems with the current implementation.
