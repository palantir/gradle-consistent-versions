  description: |-
    Fix regression from 1.11.0 where non-locked configurations could not resolve a `platform()` dependency if its constraint was declared using a `*` in `versions.props`.

    Example:
    ```
    Could not resolve all files for configuration ':some-api:conjureJava'.
       > Could not find com.palantir.witchcraft:witchcraft-core-bom:.
    ```
